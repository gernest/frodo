type Request struct {
	// Method specifies the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
	// For client requests an empty string means GET.
	Method string

	// URL specifies either the URI being requested (for server
	// requests) or the URL to access (for client requests).
	//
	// For server requests the URL is parsed from the URI
	// supplied on the Request-Line as stored in RequestURI.  For
	// most requests, fields other than Path and RawQuery will be
	// empty. (See RFC 2616, Section 5.1.2)
	//
	// For client requests, the URL's Host specifies the server to
	// connect to, while the Request's Host field optionally
	// specifies the Host header value to send in the HTTP
	// request.
	URL *url.URL
	// type URL struct {
	//     Scheme   string
	//     Opaque   string    // encoded opaque data
	//     User     *Userinfo // username and password information
	//     Host     string    // host or host:port
	//     Path     string
	//     RawQuery string // encoded query values, without '?'
	//     Fragment string // fragment for references, without '#'
	// }

	// The protocol version for incoming requests.
	// Client requests always use HTTP/1.1.
	Proto      string // "HTTP/1.0"
	ProtoMajor int    // 1
	ProtoMinor int    // 0

	// A header maps request lines to their values.
	// If the header says
	//
	//	accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
	//	Accept-Language: en-us
	//	Connection: keep-alive
	//
	// then
	//
	//	Header = map[string][]string{
	//		"Accept-Encoding": {"gzip, deflate"},
	//		"Accept-Language": {"en-us"},
	//		"Connection": {"keep-alive"},
	//	}
	//
	// HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive.
	// The request parser implements this by canonicalizing the
	// name, making the first character and any characters
	// following a hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
	//
	// For client requests certain headers are automatically
	// added and may override values in Header.
	//
	// See the documentation for the Request.Write method.
	Header Header
	// type Header map[string][]string

	// Body is the request's body.
	//
	// For client requests a nil body means the request has no
	// body, such as a GET request. The HTTP Client's Transport
	// is responsible for calling the Close method.
	//
	// For server requests the Request Body is always non-nil
	// but will return EOF immediately when no body is present.
	// The Server will close the request body. The ServeHTTP
	// Handler does not need to.
	Body io.ReadCloser

	// ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
	// The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
	// Values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
	// be read from Body.
	// For client requests, a value of 0 means unknown if Body is not nil.
	ContentLength int64

	// TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to
	// innermost. An empty list denotes the "identity" encoding.
	// TransferEncoding can usually be ignored; chunked encoding is
	// automatically added and removed as necessary when sending and
	// receiving requests.
	TransferEncoding []string

	// Close indicates whether to close the connection after
	// replying to this request (for servers) or after sending
	// the request (for clients).
	Close bool

	// For server requests Host specifies the host on which the
	// URL is sought. Per RFC 2616, this is either the value of
	// the "Host" header or the host name given in the URL itself.
	// It may be of the form "host:port".
	//
	// For client requests Host optionally overrides the Host
	// header to send. If empty, the Request.Write method uses
	// the value of URL.Host.
	Host string

	// Form contains the parsed form data, including both the URL
	// field's query parameters and the POST or PUT form data.
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores Form and uses Body instead.
	Form url.Values
	// type Values map[string][]string

	// PostForm contains the parsed form data from POST or PUT
	// body parameters.
	// This field is only available after ParseForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores PostForm and uses Body instead.
	PostForm url.Values
	// type Values map[string][]string

	// MultipartForm is the parsed multipart form, including file uploads.
	// This field is only available after ParseMultipartForm is called.
	// The HTTP client ignores MultipartForm and uses Body instead.
	MultipartForm *multipart.Form

	// Trailer specifies additional headers that are sent after the request
	// body.
	//
	// For server requests the Trailer map initially contains only the
	// trailer keys, with nil values. (The client declares which trailers it
	// will later send.)  While the handler is reading from Body, it must
	// not reference Trailer. After reading from Body returns EOF, Trailer
	// can be read again and will contain non-nil values, if they were sent
	// by the client.
	//
	// For client requests Trailer must be initialized to a map containing
	// the trailer keys to later send. The values may be nil or their final
	// values. The ContentLength must be 0 or -1, to send a chunked request.
	// After the HTTP request is sent the map values can be updated while
	// the request body is read. Once the body returns EOF, the caller must
	// not mutate Trailer.
	//
	// Few HTTP clients, servers, or proxies support HTTP trailers.
	Trailer Header

	// RemoteAddr allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// the network address that sent the request, usually for
	// logging. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest and
	// has no defined format. The HTTP server in this package
	// sets RemoteAddr to an "IP:port" address before invoking a
	// handler.
	// This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
	RemoteAddr string

	// RequestURI is the unmodified Request-URI of the
	// Request-Line (RFC 2616, Section 5.1) as sent by the client
	// to a server. Usually the URL field should be used instead.
	// It is an error to set this field in an HTTP client request.
	RequestURI string

	// TLS allows HTTP servers and other software to record
	// information about the TLS connection on which the request
	// was received. This field is not filled in by ReadRequest.
	// The HTTP server in this package sets the field for
	// TLS-enabled connections before invoking a handler;
	// otherwise it leaves the field nil.
	// This field is ignored by the HTTP client.
	TLS *tls.ConnectionState
